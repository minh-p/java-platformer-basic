# Java Basic Platformer
A 2d platformer in which uses inputs to control a "player".

### Introduction
This project's purpose is to learn for myself, getting better at Java and as well as getting to know some libraries.
I have studied how to create games before. So this should be mangable for me.
This project for me should take around 2 weeks and a half.

### What I hope to get from this:
- Better knowledge of how to do OOP in java.
- The use of libraries and as well as understanding how to read java's documentation.
- Something to finally get my programming journey back on track.
- To be able to create my first game without a game engine (in which I have only used one game engine ever before xd).
- Understand how to use unit-testing and professional stuff.

* Tools used: Should just be vanilla java.
