### Libraries used:
- Slick2d:
    - Using this library, will reduce game development timeline and the knowledge
that I don't have.
    - I am going to read this library's wiki and documentation out.
    - This would include: Animation, inputs, background setting, and as well as camera simulation

- Maybe let's not use Slick2d. Instead just use JPanel and swing.
